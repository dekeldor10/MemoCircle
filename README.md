Hello Michal and others, welcome to MemoCircle! Your 360 notes app.
Before you run the app on your device or read the code itself, there are a few things to keep in mind:
1. The app is not finished yet. I still need to make it look better and hopefully add the whole tags system for the public notes.
2. Due to a lack of time, most of my designing time went to the dark theme of the app - because this is what my own phone uses. FOR THE OPTIMAL COLOR PALETTE and full UX - please set your device to "Dark Mode" before opening my app.
3. I use Firebase Phone Authentication for user sign-up, sign-in, and user managment. Unfortunately, Firebase limits the amout of SMS's sent a day, so as of now THE SMS SENDING IS DISABLED. However, if you still want to experiance all the app has to offer in the online tab - you can use two built-in users i created. the info for them is:
First User: phone number: +11234567891, SMS authntication code: 111222.
Second User: phone number: +11234567892, SMS authentication code: 123123.

I'll fix those things in time for the Bagrut. Enjoy! I had fun making this app.
